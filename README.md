# ObjectDetection
Object detection and image capture with yolov4
DESCRIPTION:
This project uses the darknet repository to utilize YOLOv4 in order to identify and save pictures from the webcam. This system can be utilized in security or monitoring systems that have camera feed as their data. The project captures image from the webcam and using the defined functions as well as the darknet's functions identifies the object in the image as well as creates a bounding box marking the image and the probability of the correctness of the prediction. Finally the image is saved in the memory.
